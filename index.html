            Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.<pr />
            Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br />
            It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.

        <p class="poem">
            We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?<br />
            Actually, who are you not to be? <br>

            Your playing small does not serve the world.<br />
            There is nothing enlightened about shrinking<br />
            so that other people won't feel insecure around you. <br>

            We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br />
            And as we let our own light shine,<br />
            we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.<br />
            As we are liberated from our own fear,<br />
            our presence automatically liberates others. <br>
